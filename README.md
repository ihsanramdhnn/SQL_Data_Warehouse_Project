# üß† SQL Data Warehouse Project
This learning project was designed to build practical experience in designing, developing, and implementing a modern data warehouse using SQL Server.
The project follows the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers), widely used in scalable data platforms.

## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture Overview
**Bronze Layer**
Ingests raw data directly from source systems (CSV files from ERP and CRM) and stores them in SQL Server without modification.

**Silver Layer**
Performs data cleansing, standardization, normalization, and deduplication to prepare clean, structured data for analytical use.

**Gold Layer**
Contains business-ready data modeled into a star schema, with optimized fact and dimension tables used for reporting and analytics.
